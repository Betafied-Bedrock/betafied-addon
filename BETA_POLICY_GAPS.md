# Beta policy gaps

Open decisions found while collapsing the three parallel Beta truth tables (`betaRegistry.ts`,
`normalizer.ts`, `compatibilityPolicy.ts`) into one owner each. Each item below is a place where a
declared rule and the shipped behaviour disagree. None of them is a bug in the collapse itself —
they are pre-existing, and they were previously invisible because a test asserted the declared table
rather than the code path that runs.

Deciding an item means picking one of:

- **Implement** — make the code do what the rule says (a gameplay change, needs an in-game look).
- **Drop the rule** — accept the current behaviour and delete the claim.
- **Keep written down** — leave it here as a known, intentional difference.

## 1. Inventory conversions that were declared but never implemented

`compatibilityPolicy.ITEM_CONVERSIONS` was deleted: it had no production consumer, and
`normalizeItem` — the function the inventory sweep actually calls — does not implement many of its
entries. Today these ids are **deleted on pickup** rather than converted, because they fall through
every heuristic in `normalizer.normalizeItem` to `{ action: "remove" }`:

| Item | Declared target | Current behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `minecraft:mud`, `minecraft:muddy_mangrove_roots` | `minecraft:dirt` | removed |
| `minecraft:suspicious_sand` | `minecraft:sand` | removed |
| `minecraft:suspicious_gravel` | `minecraft:gravel` | removed |
| `minecraft:bamboo_block` | `minecraft:oak_log` | removed |
| `minecraft:crafting_table` | `bh:crafting_table` | removed |
| the 18 post-Beta flowers (`cornflower`, `allium`, `lilac`, `sunflower`, …) | `minecraft:poppy` | removed |
| `minecraft:white_dye`, `black_dye`, `blue_dye`, `brown_dye` | `bone_meal`, `ink_sac`, `lapis_lazuli`, `cocoa_beans` | removed |
| `minecraft:packed_ice`, `minecraft:blue_ice` | `minecraft:ice` | removed |
| the 17 `*_terracotta` variants | `minecraft:clay` | removed |

The terracotta and brick cases are the ones to think about hardest, because world terrain *does*
repaint them: `BLOCK_BULK_REPLACEMENTS` maps every terracotta to sandstone. So a mined terracotta
block currently becomes sandstone on the ground, which is consistent — but the matching item id
silently vanishes if it arrives any other way.

## 2. `stone_bricks` has two contradictory stances

`normalizer.test.ts` asserts `normalizeBlock("minecraft:stone_bricks")` is **removed** (Beta 1.7.3
had no stone bricks), while the deleted table claimed `stone_bricks → minecraft:stone`. The collapse
kept the removal, since the scrubber's job is to erase blocks the era never had. Worth confirming
that deleting a player's stone bricks is the intent rather than converting them to stone.

## 3. Resolved: `raw_copper` lands on cobblestone on both paths

The ore-drop special case used to send `normalizeEntityDrop("minecraft:raw_copper")` to
`minecraft:iron_ore` while `normalizeItem` answered `minecraft:cobblestone`. Copper is now absent
from `ORE_DROP_CONVERSIONS`, so a ground pickup falls through to `normalizeItem` like any other
post-Beta item — both paths reach cobblestone through one owner.

## 4. Resolved: vanilla fences are moved onto `bh:fence`

`BETA_BLOCK_IDS` lists `minecraft:oak_fence` as authentic, so `normalizeItem` still answers `keep`
for it — but that layer answers "may this id exist in the world", which is true and separately
pinned by a test. A **held** item never reaches that answer alone: `inventoryManager` consults the
placer table first, which now retypes every `*_fence` and `*_fence_gate` onto `bh:fence`, and
`recipes/oak_fence.json` overrides vanilla's `minecraft:fence` recipe id so a crafted fence is already
the custom block. `tests/policy/inventoryManager.test.ts` pins the retyping.

Still open: the **chunk scrubber** keeps world-placed vanilla fences, because `normalizeBlock` treats
`minecraft:oak_fence` as authentic terrain. A fence generated into the world therefore still cannot
connect to a `bh:fence` line, which is the only remaining way two fence families can coexist. Decide
whether the scrubber should convert them.

## 6. Fence connectivity stays in script, deliberately

Swapping `bh:fence` onto the declarative `minecraft:connection` trait was investigated and rejected on
three points, all from the official block reference:

- The trait "requires Bedrock Edition 1.21.130 or higher, and currently requires that the 'Upcoming
  Creator Features' experimental toggle is set on". A world without that experiment would lose fence
  connectivity outright, where the script works anywhere. The pack's manifest enables no experimental
  toggles by policy.
- The trait exposes four booleans (`minecraft:connection_north` and friends), not the single 4-bit
  `bh:connections` mask the block and its Molang `bone_visibility` are built around. That makes the
  switch a rewrite that also has to drop the custom state.
- `minecraft:connection_rule.accepts_connections_from` offers only `all`, `none` and `only_fences`,
  and `only_fences` is documented as "all Vanilla fences excluding NetherBrick". A custom `bh:fence`
  is not a vanilla fence, so the rule cannot express fence-to-fence connectivity.

So the script remains the owner. Its known weakness is that it recomputes only on player place and
break, meaning a fence whose neighbour changes some other way — a command, a structure, generation —
keeps a stale connection mask.

## 5. Loot-table vocabulary (partly resolved)

The vanilla behavior pack under `reference-docs/…/VanillaBehaviorPack` settles the item-id question
this note previously left open: Bedrock's raw and cooked fish are `minecraft:fish` / `minecraft:cooked_fish`,
and a coloured wool is `minecraft:wool` with `minecraft:set_data_from_color_index`. `minecraft:cod` is
the *entity* identifier, never an item.

Resolved here:

- `normalizer.FOOD_CONVERSIONS` now also maps `minecraft:fish` / `minecraft:cooked_fish`, and
  `betaRegistry.BETA_ITEM_IDS` registers them, so a caught fish lands on `bh:cod` / `bh:cooked_cod`
  instead of being swept. The `cod` / `salmon` spellings stay as harmless aliases.
- `loot_tables/entities/sheep.json` gained the `minecraft:set_data_from_color_index` function it was
  missing, so the death drop resolves the sheep's colour the way the shear table already did.
- The zombie feather drop was removed from `entitySpawnHandler`; `loot_tables/entities/zombie.json` is
  now the single owner of that drop.
- `toolMining.SWORD_FAST_BLOCKS` dropped the legacy ids (`web`, `leaves`, `leaves2`, `wooden_stairs`,
  `wool`) that never resolve on this engine, and takes its palette from `betaRegistry.WOOL_BY_COLOR`.

Still open, and genuinely engine-dependent: the pack's own fishing tables sit at
`loot_tables/fishing.json` and `loot_tables/fishing/*.json`, not at the vanilla
`loot_tables/gameplay/fishing/*.json` path the fishing hook reads, so nothing loads them until an
override is placed on the vanilla path. Confirm in-game which tables the hook uses, then either move
these onto the vanilla path or delete them.

## 7. Ore generation (partly resolved — needs an in-game look)

Beta 1.7.3 had no emerald (arrived in 1.3) and no copper (1.17), but both still generate on modern
terrain. Two mechanisms now cover that, deliberately at different layers:

- **Generation:** `features/emerald_ore_feature.json`, `copper_ore_feature.json` and
  `dripstone_caves_copper_ore_feature.json` are inert `ore_feature` stubs, following the same
  override-by-identifier pattern as the vine, glow-lichen and fallen-tree stubs. This keeps the ores
  out of *new* chunks instead of generating and then erasing them.
- **Scrubber (the guaranteed net):** `BLOCK_BULK_REPLACEMENTS` maps `emerald_ore` and
  `deepslate_emerald_ore` to `minecraft:stone`. The old table sent `emerald_ore` through
  `normalizeBlock`, which had no entry for it and defaulted to `remove` — every emerald vein in
  already-generated ground was being scrubbed to **air**, punching ore-shaped holes in terrain.Still engine-dependent: whether a behavior pack's ore-feature stub actually pre-empts vanilla's ore feature rule has to be confirmed in-game, the same caveat the vine/lichen stubs carry. If it does not, the scrubber mapping above is what keeps the world correct.

**Retuned (needs an in-game look).** Vanilla spreads each surviving Beta ore across several modern
split rules, so overriding one file would only move part of the density. The pack now owns both
halves:

- `feature_rules/` carries one override per vanilla rule identifier — the primary rule for coal,
  iron, gold, redstone, diamond and lapis keeps its `minecraft:` identifier and scatters a new
  `bh:beta_*_ore_feature` with Beta's per-chunk attempt count and height band; the 14 split
  variants (upper/lower/middle/small/buried/large/square, plus the mesa and mountains specials)
  are neutered with a biome filter on a tag no biome carries, so nothing double-fires on top of
  Beta's counts.
- The six `features/beta_*_ore_feature.json` files set Beta's vein sizes and only replace the
  stone family, so a vein never eats surface blocks. The numbers: coal 20 attempts × 16 blocks,
  y 0–128; iron 20 × 8, y 0–64; gold 2 × 8, y 0–32; redstone 8 × 7, y 0–16; diamond 1 × 7,
  y 0–16; lapis 1 × 6, scattered as a triangle over y 0–32 so it clusters around y16 the way
  Beta's did. Y-bands are half-open and match Java's `nextInt(max - min) + min` exactly.
  The height bands and the redstone-8/diamond-1 attempt counts are verified against the
  pre-Caves-&-Cliffs distribution tables; the 7/7/6 vein sizes for redstone, diamond and lapis
  are the classic pre-1.8 figures and are the least certain entry here — confirm them in-game.

Three things to confirm in-game, in order of blast radius: (1) that a pack file overriding a
vanilla feature *rule* by identifier actually replaces it (the recipe and feature stubs rely on
the same mechanism, but no rule override has been proven yet); (2) that no modern variant rule
outside the 14 listed in `tests/smoke/fallenTrees.test.ts` still fires — the `/place` command's
rule list is where those identifiers came from; (3) that the triangle scatter lands lapis's peak
where intended.

## 8. Farmland trampling is re-added by script, and only half of it (needs an in-game look)

Beta 1.7.3's trampling lived in the engine, not in the farmland block: `Entity.moveEntity` resolved the
walked block as `floor(posY - 0.2)`, fired that block's `onEntityWalking` once per 1/0.6 blocks of
horizontal travel, and `BlockFarmland.onEntityWalking` answered with `rand.nextInt(4) == 0` → dirt.
Bedrock only tramples farmland when something *lands* on it, so the walking half was missing entirely —
`interactions/cropTrampling.ts` re-adds it, keeping the era's step cadence, its 1-in-4 roll, and both
of the exemptions that second line carried.

Decided and implemented:

- **The fence trick is fence-specific.** The maintainer described it as "a block placed under the
  farmland", but the 1.7.3 call site swapped the walked block for the block beneath it only when that
  block was `Block.fence`; every other block was irrelevant. `isFenceBlock` therefore follows the fence
  family (`bh:fence`, `minecraft:fence`, `*_fence`) and deliberately not fence gates. A vanilla gate
  left by terrain or a command protects nothing; a *placed* one is retyped onto `bh:fence` and does.
- **The sneak exemption is the era's own rule.** `var18 = this.onGround && this.isSneaking()` gated the
  callback, so a sneaking player on the ground never trampled — and a sneaking entity in mid-air still
  did. Both halves are pinned by tests.
- **A rider tramples nothing with their own feet.** The same condition carried `ridingEntity == null`, so
  a player crossing a farm on a horse left no trample behind; the mount still tramples, because it is an
  entity walking in its own right, exactly as it would have in 1.7.3.
- **Mobs trample, not only players.** `canTriggerWalking()` was true for every entity, and the mob
  sweep covers animals within 24 blocks of a player. This is the constant to reconsider first if a
  server finds animal trampling too punishing.
- **Creative and Spectator are exempt from the walking rule only.** Neither mode has a Beta
  counterpart, and a builder flying over a farm should not convert it back to dirt — but that reasoning
  belongs to the behaviour this module *adds*. The landing guard serves every mode, because it is undoing
  an engine behaviour the era never had, and the engine tramples in Creative exactly as it does in
  Survival. Gating the guard on the mode hid the whole feature from a creative-mode builder through a
  day of testing: the log read `mode=Creative watch=0 fix=0` while a farm turned to dirt under a jump.
- **Bedrock's landing trample is undone, not prevented.** 1.7.3 never looked at `fallDistance`, so a
  standing jump trampled nothing; Bedrock tramples on any landing, fence or no fence, which made
  jumping on a farm destroy it. The engine converts the block inside its own tick with no script hook
  in front of it, so the module watches the column a falling entity is heading for, and puts the
  farmland (moisture included) and its crop (growth included) back from that snapshot, clearing the
  crop drops the break spawned so the restore cannot be farmed for free. This is also what makes the
  fence trick total again, as it was in the era. The snapshot is taken for every sampled entity on
  every pass and asks `Entity.isOnGround` nothing: that property is documented to behave unexpectedly,
  and skipping the pass before a landing is the one mistake this guard cannot recover from. The
  passability question during the downward scan is answered by a small set of block types rather than
  by `Block.isSolid`, which is pre-release surface — see the `betafied/no-beta-api` warnings.
- **The walking rule takes the crop down itself, and pays the era's drop for it.** Waiting for
  Bedrock's neighbour update to pop the crop is a dependency on engine behaviour this module cannot
  check offline, and a plant left standing on dirt is the visible half of the trample — so the crop is
  broken explicitly, before the farmland is set to dirt (afterwards the engine's own update would be
  free to pop it and pay the modern loot table instead). The drop is `cropDropsFor`: `BlockCrops` in
  1.7.3 answered `idDropped(meta) -> meta == 7 ? Item.wheat : -1` and then ran three independent
  `rand.nextInt(15) <= meta` seed rolls, so a ripe crop pays one wheat and up to three seeds and an
  unripe one can pay nothing at all — not the guaranteed seed modern versions hand out. **Wheat is the
  only crop this models, on purpose**: carrots, potatoes, melons and beetroot all post-date 1.7.3, the
  block registry agrees, and a post-Beta crop growing on a farm belongs to `compatibilityPolicy` — so it
  is left standing rather than silently deleted with no drop.

Still open:

- **The correction is visible for a tick.** The tile is dirt and the crop is popped until the pass
  that restores them, which is one tick if that pass lands after the engine's, two if before. Needs an
  in-game look to decide whether that flicker is acceptable.
- **The drop sweep is scoped by radius and item id.** A harvest the engine spawned when it popped a
  crop is removed from the crop cell within 0.9 blocks of its centre, so a restore cannot be farmed for
  free; a seed a player dropped into that exact spot in that same tick would go with it.
- **Mob landings are best-effort.** Mobs are swept every other pass, so a mob that crosses more
  columns between two sweeps than the lookahead covers (`LANDING_LOOKAHEAD`, three) can still trample a
  tile nothing watched. Players are watched every tick, which makes the same lookahead worth about four
  blocks of travel a tick for them — further than a sprint-jump, an elytra glide or a knockback slide
  normally moves.
- **The landing guard cannot be verified offline at all.** It was confirmed in game once, through
  temporary `cropTrampling:` traces that have since been removed: the guard watched the right tile, read
  the farmland under the crop correctly, and was skipped entirely in Creative — which is the bug those
  traces were written to find. Re-adding a trace is the way to check it again.

## 9. Doubled slabs are script-assembled, and only across the pack's own halves

Beta 1.7.3's `BlockSlab` rebuilt two halves as one full block, so `interactions/slabStacking.ts`
assembles `bh:double_*_slab` from the slab a player places against a matching one. The merged block
has no `menu_category` and no item definition on purpose: Beta's doubled slab was never a holdable
item, and mining it pays the two halves back through its loot table.

Still open: a **vanilla** half never merges with a `bh:` one. The inventory sweep retypes every held
`*_slab` onto its `bh:` id and the scrubber leaves world-placed `minecraft:*_slab` alone because
`BETA_BLOCK_IDS` calls it authentic terrain, so the only vanilla halves left are ones a structure,
an old save or a command placed — the same coexistence §4 describes for fences. Plumbing a mixed pair
would first have to answer which family the full block belongs to, so the two families stay apart
until someone decides that.

## Why this file exists

The failure mode these items share is the one worth guarding against: a rule was written down in one
file, the behaviour lived in another, and a test in a third asserted the rule rather than the
behaviour. Every case above was green in CI while the game did something else.
