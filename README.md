## About

**Betafied** is an authentic recreation of **Minecraft Beta 1.7.3** running inside modern **Bedrock Edition** (Script API 2.11.0-beta). 

This is not a cosmetic texture pack with a nostalgia filter placed over modern gameplay. It is a ground-up behavioral reconstruction of how Minecraft actually behaved in the summer of 2011: the instant-heal food system, the machine-gun bow, Beta terrain generation, pre-1.8 mob AI, classic physics, and the atmospheric void fog. Modern items, blocks, and mobs are transparently converted to era-appropriate equivalents rather than deleted, keeping the experience pure and seamless.

Betafied is 100% open source under the **[GNU AGPLv3](LICENSE)**. Fork it, run your own server, and build something legendary with it.

### Transparent Item & Block Normalization
When players pick up, mine, or encounter post-Beta items, blocks, or loot, Betafied's generator-driven normalization pipeline automatically converts them into their closest historical equivalents. Builders and staff can bypass conversion using privileged tags (`builder_exempt`).

## Quick Start

### For Players

<details open>
<summary><b>Option A: Join the Official Server (No Download Required)</b></summary>
<br>

Connect directly to the dedicated multiplayer server. Both behavior and resource packs are downloaded and synced automatically when you connect:

- **Server Address**: `betafied.net`
- **Port**: Default Bedrock Port (`19132`)
- **Website**: [betafied.net](https://betafied.net)

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Option B: Install Singleplayer / Custom Server (.mcaddon)</b></summary>
<br>

1. Download the latest `.mcaddon` bundle from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/retrofit-studios/betafied/releases).
2. Open the downloaded file with Minecraft Bedrock (the game will automatically import both the Behavior Pack and Resource Pack).
3. In your world settings:
   - Activate the **Betafied Behavior Pack**.
   - Activate the **Betafied Resource Pack**.
4. Play! Requires Minecraft Bedrock **1.26.51** or newer.

</details>

---

### For Developers

Betafied requires **Node.js 24+** and the **[Regolith](https://bedrock-oss.github.io/regolith/)** compiler toolchain.

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/retrofit-studios/betafied.git
cd betafied

# 2. Install dependencies & Regolith filters
npm install
npm run install-filters

# 3. Build packs
npm run build

# 4. Run the quality gate (typecheck, lint, and 470+ automated tests)
npm run check
```

## Architecture

Betafied is structured into modular subsystems under `packs/BP/scripts/`. TypeScript source files are transpiled to QuickJS-compatible JavaScript through Regolith.

<details>
<summary><b>Explore Subsystem Directory Layout</b></summary>
<br>

| Subsystem | Location | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Core** | `packs/BP/scripts/core/` | Event bus dispatching, priority management, tick loop scheduler, and error boundaries. |
| **Player** | `packs/BP/scripts/player/` | Instant food consumption, health restoration, off-hand stripping, and join banners. |
| **Combat** | `packs/BP/scripts/combat/` | Rapid-fire bow logic and the linear armor damage reduction formula. |
| **Interactions** | `packs/BP/scripts/interactions/` | Furnace minecarts, boat collisions, instant bonemeal, block placement rules, and double chests. |
| **World** | `packs/BP/scripts/world/` | 128-block height ceiling, dimension boundary enforcement, chunk scrubber, bedrock floor, and void fog. |
| **Mobs** | `packs/BP/scripts/mobs/` | Mob spawning allowlists, post-Beta entity cleaner, animal wandering AI, and nightmare ambushes. |

## Credits & History

- **Origins**: Betafied originated from **cen0b**'s early Bedrock add-on.
- **Evolution**: Expanded in 2025 by **xzelleiv**, **Arxance**, **uptightsuperlabs**, and contributors across the Bedrock add-on scene.
- **Version 4.0 Rewrite**: The entire gameplay engine was rebuilt from the ground up on modern Bedrock Script APIs, establishing the current modular architecture.

## A Note on AI Development

Betafied is developed by a few people in close collaboration with AI coding agents.

The agents help write automated test suites, draft changes, and run code-health scans that surface technical debt. Every commit is authored and reviewed by hand, agents do not commit or push independently, and nothing is merged unless the full quality gate (`npm run check`) is green. The AI sometimes writes code, but the behavior it targets comes directly from authentic Minecraft Beta 1.7.3.
