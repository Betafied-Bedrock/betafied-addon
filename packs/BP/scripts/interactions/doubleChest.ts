/**
 * Beta 1.7.3 double chests are two blocks sharing one 54-slot inventory. Bedrock cannot hand a
 * custom multi-block a shared container: every part of a multi-block owns its own block entity
 * by design (26.50 changelog), and no stable API opens one block entity's container for another.
 *
 * So the pair keeps exactly one half as the items' home ("master", part 0) and moves the
 * contents into whichever half a player opens, moving them back once the pair goes idle. The
 * contents are only ever moved, never copied, which is what keeps an interrupted session (a
 * crash, a broken chest, an explosion) from duplicating or double-dropping a single stack.
